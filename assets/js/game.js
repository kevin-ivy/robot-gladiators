//Game States
//"WIN" - Player robot has defeated all enemy robots
//  *Fight all enemy robots
//  *Defeat each enemy robot
// "LOSE" - Player robot's health is zero or less

// Store and Restart Functionality
// Create startGame() to store game logic
// When player is defeated or no more enemies, call endGame()
// * Alert the player's total stats
// * Ask if they want to play again
// * If yes, call startGame() to reset the game
// After player skips or defeats enemy (with more opponents remaining)
// * Ask if the player wants to shop
// * If no, continue as normal
// * If yes, call shop()
// In shop() ask player if they want to refill health, upgrade attack, or leave.
// * If Refill, subtract money and increase health
// * If Upgrade, subtract money adn increase attack
// * If leave, alert goodbye and exit
// * If any other invalid optionn, call shop() again
